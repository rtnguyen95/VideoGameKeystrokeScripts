Literally just clicks at specified time interval

*Pre-Condition: You might need to have Auto Hot Key (AHK) installed to edit and re-compile the script if you want to make changes.
However the .exe file should work as is, but it is currently only designed for the purpose of redeeming monster life vouchers.*

1. Run NvWizz.exe as administrator.

2. Hover mouse over icon of item stack (in this case I'm using monster life gem vouchers).

3. Press `CTRL + J` to start the program.

4. Put a paper weight on your enter key or just hold it down with your finger.

5. AFK

6. When finished press `CTRL + P` to pause or `CTRL + ESC` to completely close the program.
	**Sometimes a click or keystroke will come in between your `CTRL + P / ESC` so it won't actually pause or close.
	You can just go into your tasks on the bottom right of your screen and close the program manually.
	However I just press `CTRL + ESC` until the Windows start menu pops up. That's how I know it closed sucessfully via the quick command. 


Additional notes: You can probably adjust the click timings to do occult cubing for when you want to throw thousands of cubes to tier up mule gear.


Numerical timings on the AHK file are in milliseconds.
Example: `Sleep (3900)` indicates the system will pause for 3.9 seconds before continuing the next command.
