# VideoGameKeystrokeScripts

A collection of various scripts built using Auto Hot Key (AHK).
The main idea was to test the use of scripts to send keystrokes at regular time intervals, potentially automating several tasks.

Some knowledge of functions such as `random()` were from previous experience with JavaScript,
re-implemented to work in .AHK files.


**This project was done purely as a hobby. I do not condone using bots and/or scripts to break any game developers' Terms of Service agreements. I do not support the use of these programs for malicious practices.**
