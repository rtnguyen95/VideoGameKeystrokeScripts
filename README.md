# VideoGameKeystrokeScripts

A collection of various scripts built using Auto Hot Key (AHK).
The main idea was to send keystrokes at regular time intervals to automate several tasks.

Some knowledge of functions such as `random()` were from previous experience with JavaScript,
re-implemented to work in .AHK files.
